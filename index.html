        <p>Solvespace is a solid model 3D CAD program created by Jonathan Westhues. It uses a parametric design approach driven by geometric solving constraints. Key features are:*   Easy to learn with an intuitive user interface – simple but efficient*   It can be used to model mechanical behaviour during movements*   Solves geometrical constrained problems. *   Lends itself to 3D printing. Export obj file for direct import in Slic3 *   More robust than Sketch-up for generating manifold models*   No set-up needed – runs directly as a small executable and very fast<em>…Extrude, Lathe (spheres), merge and exclude objects</em>…Import componentsBeware of still missing features:*   No import*…No advanced geometries (e.g. screw threads). I.e. no ‘follow-me’ as in Sketch-up or macros as in FreeCAD or OpenScadRead more at the original author at <a href="http://solvespace.com/index.pl">http://solvespace.com/index.pl</a> where you find the original program, manuals and exellent tutorials. Please check the forumThis branch has implemented a few enhancements related to the user interface.Summary of changes.    Navigating groups with PgUp/Dwn (16/12/2014)    Lines/Circles/Arcs items are named &amp; can be renamed (Shortcut F2)   Constraints uses named items    Option for speeding up rendering (disable bad constraint suggestions)   The include file can now be changed via the command window  Fixed rendering when saving.    Enabled deletion of the active group    Scale import files by x,y,z factor  Change filename of import files Now DOF for the active group is shown in the ‘Browser’ 16/12/2014   Double click an entity to activate its Group</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
