Version 2.1eMVe2

Copy equal radius constraint
Let's say that we are in conceptual state of designing our part
and we need to place 50 or so holes onto a piece of sheet
and we don't know their exact size. They may be 2.5 or 2.7 mm.
So we create the first hole and constrain it to 2.5mm.
Then we create a copy of it and constrain it to the first one,
which involves selecting both and pressing Q. Then we repeat
the last step 48 times.
So for this special case we can copy the equal constraint now.
We create the first hole, then we create copy of it,
then we constrain the first hole to 2.5mm.
Then we constrain the both holes to be equal.
We have 2 holes now. The first one with diameter constraint
(master) and its first equal copy (slave).
We switch the copy constraints on, copy the slave hole
(select and Ctrl+C) and paste it 48 times.

Copy horizontal constraint
Copy vertical constraint
Copy dimension constraint
We construct rectangle of exact size and making its copy
with copy constraints on is matter of pressing Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.

Copy diameter constraint
This is needed when we construct more sophisticated holes with
arcs and line segments. The copied arcs shall be diameter constrained
to their originals.
