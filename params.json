{"name":"Solvespace","tagline":"Version 2.1 eMVe branch for VS2013 IDE","body":"Solvespace is a solid model 3D CAD program created by Jonathan Westhues. It uses a parametric design approach driven by geometric solving constraints. Key features are:*   Easy to learn with an intuitive user interface – simple but efficient*   It can be used to model mechanical behaviour during movements*   Solves geometrical constrained problems. *   Lends itself to 3D printing. Export obj file for direct import in Slic3 *   More robust than Sketch-up for generating manifold models*   No set-up needed – runs directly as a small executable and very fast*…Extrude, Lathe (spheres), merge and exclude objects*…Import componentsBeware of still missing features:*   No import*…No advanced geometries (e.g. screw threads). I.e. no ‘follow-me’ as in Sketch-up or macros as in FreeCAD or OpenScadRead more at the original author at http://solvespace.com/index.pl where you find the original program, manuals and exellent tutorials. Please check the forumThis branch has implemented a few enhancements related to the user interface.Summary of changes. \tNavigating groups with PgUp/Dwn (16/12/2014)\tLines/Circles/Arcs items are named & can be renamed (Shortcut F2)\tConstraints uses named items\tOption for speeding up rendering (disable bad constraint suggestions)\tThe include file can now be changed via the command window\tFixed rendering when saving.\tEnabled deletion of the active group\tScale import files by x,y,z factor\tChange filename of import files\tNow DOF for the active group is shown in the ‘Browser’ 16/12/2014\tDouble click an entity to activate its Group\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
